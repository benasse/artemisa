Artemisa 1.2
------------

Troubleshooting
===============


1) Artemisa doesn't find my audio device.

	The audio device must be under the file /dev/dsp.

	If you are using Fedora or another distro that uses Pulse Audio, 
	you can try, running as root, the following commands:

	modprobe snd_mixer_oss
	modprobe snd_pcm_oss
	modprobe snd_seq_oss

	This should create /dev/dsp.
