Ideas for future implementations:

* Two fingerprint modes: passive and active (currently just passive mode is available).
* Relate the traceroute results to google maps.
* Develop the "aggressive" mode in order to counterattack the intruder.
* Export some variables to be used by the automatically executed scripts (one can, for example configure a firewall automatically).
